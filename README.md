_We are all human beings, being human._

## Philosophy

Yes, and…  
Name things once.  
Assume good intentions.  
Only ask for permission once.  
Simplicity is hard but essential.  
Use one file until you need another.  
Use one folder until you need another.  
Submit to defaults until you have a strong reason to deviate.

Deeply think, learn constantly, make unexpected connections, and articulate complex ideas with confidence in a strategic vision.

## Who I Am

A former US Army paratrooper and Ranger. I have worked in large and very large corporations, small startups, and middling scale-ups where I specialize in learning new skills.

I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University at Albany and continue learning daily through challenges, conversations, and skill acquisition.

## Beyond Work

When not solving complex problems, you might find me:

- Traversing backcountry trails with everything I need on my back.
- Exploring far-flung corners of the world.
- Crafting the perfect balance of flavors in a cocktail glass.
- Finding rhythm and meaning in spoken word.
