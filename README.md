_We are all human beings, being human._

## Who I Am

I think deeply, learn constantly, make unexpected connections, and articulate complex ideas while maintaining confidence in a strategic vision.

Former US Army paratrooper and Ranger, I've navigated both corporate landscapes and startup terrains, specializing in learning how to do the next thing we must do.

## Philosophy

> Simplicity is hard but mandatory.  
> Use one file until you need another.  
> Use one folder until you need another.  
> Name things once.  
> Submit to defaults until you have a strong reason.  
> Ask permission only once.  
> Yes, and...  
> Assume good intentions.

## Background

I hold a BA in Political Science from SUNY Albany, but my education continues daily through challenges, conversations, and the constant pursuit of the next necessary skill.

## Beyond Work

When not solving complex problems, you might find me:

- Traversing backcountry trails with everything I need on my back.
- Exploring far-flung corners of the world.
- Crafting the perfect balance of flavors in a cocktail glass.
- Finding rhythm and meaning in spoken word.
