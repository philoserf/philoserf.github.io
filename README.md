Mark is a human being, being human. He lives in Edmonds, a small town in Washington State -- United States of America. His home provides the advantages of a great city and a small coastal village in a region nestled between mountain ranges, divided by the Salish Sea, and a series of freshwater lakes and rivers. Mark lived in Italy for a year in the early 1980s and Turkey for a year in the early 1990s. He earned a degree in political science at The University at Albany, State University of New York.

Mark works on improving technological systems, services, and processes for a leading fashion retailer in Seattle, USA. In the past he has worked for Samsungâ€™s Cloud Native Computing Team; wrote and supported APIs for Nordstrom mobile applications; supported ESPN.com for The Walt Disney Company; supported information systems and information security for dental and medical insurance companies; served as both an enlisted airborne infantryman and a U.S. Army officer; and held a few more less noteworthy positions too.
