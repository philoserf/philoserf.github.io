_Human beings, being human._

## Philosophy

Yes, andâ€¦
Name things once.
Assume good intentions.
Ask permission once, then proceed.
Embrace necessary simplicity.
One file until you need another.
One folder until you need another.
Default first, deviate deliberately.
Think deeply. Learn constantly. Connect unexpectedly. Articulate clearly.
